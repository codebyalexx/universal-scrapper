# Universal Scrapper

Hello, world to Universal Scrapper repository. Universal Scrapper is a project born by the desire of publishing a open source tool to scrape website assets such as images and videos BUT for a large variety of websites.

I think that this kind of project should be published as open source as it's more easy to deploy app localy for everyone. It could be a Saas but this is not legal (depending on your coutry). The project's directive is to cover much websites as possibles and it's for this reason too that open source is the good way to do!

## FAQ

#### The website that I want to scrappe is not supported by tool, can I try the scrappe anyway?

Yes! If the website is not listed in supported website, you can try to use the tool. In >50% of cases, it will work but not perfectly, as it will don't distingish images such as icons etc... from the images that you want to download. **In case it doesn't work** : contribute to the project, or contact me (contact infos above) to find a solution! You can open a issue too!

#### What's the mega super secret feature that will be developped soon?

The feature that I'd love to work to is a GPT tool to make a summary of each pages of a X website. It could be exported to a simple txt file or pushed on a blog using an API, generating a PDF... etc...
